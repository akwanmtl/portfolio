      I have always had an interest in developing applications that simplify tasks. Prior to the Bootcamp, I have built a website with a goal to make language-exchange more interactive and a Matlab-based GUI to visualize and analyze data. Now, I have gained more knowledge and skills and have built applications geared towards aspiring cooks and book lovers to further expand their hobbies. You can find all my projects <span><Link to="/projects">here</Link></span>

      When you don't find me working, you can find me in the kitchen baking sweet treats or outside enjoying a nice long walk. I also enjoy playing video games, in particular, Smash Bros and I'm always looking for a friendly competition.
