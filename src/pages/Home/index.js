      I have always had an interest in developing applications that simplify tasks. Prior to the Bootcamp, I have built a website with a goal to make language-exchange more interactive and a Matlab-based GUI to visualize and analyze data. Now, I have gained more knowledge and skills and have built applications geared towards aspiring cooks and book lovers to further expand their hobbies. You can find all my projects here

      When you don't find me working, you can find me in the kitchen baking sweet treats or outside enjoying a nice long walk. I also enjoy playing video games, in particular, Smash Bros and I'm always looking for friendly competition.
