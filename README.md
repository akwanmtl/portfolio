# Porfolio - React

## Description
This is my portfolio built using React and Bootstrap. I have also used React Animated-CSS to make the pages animated and used Formspree to render the contact page functional. The main components are a Navbar and sticky footer shown on multiple pages and my projects are displayed by reusing the same card and modal components. This is deployed on Github Pages
